And relying on that information,To place police cars.
In the project we relied on the road accidents in Israel that have happened over the past ten years and working on that data with probabilistic models and artificial intelligence algorithms.
As part of the project, we used the methods we learned from the course Artificial Intelligence and new methods that we learned while the project and examined their effect on the results of the classifier.

we have been a group of three people and all the project done with python.
all the implement information and more details about the project could be found in the report.
